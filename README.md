# Cyber Kill Chain Lab
<b>Platform:</b> TryHackMe | <b>Type:</b> Hands-on Lab | <b>Focus:</b> Adversary Behavior Analysis, Attack Lifecycle, Threat Detection
<h2>Overview:</h2>
In this lab, I explored the Cyber Kill Chain, a model developed by Lockheed Martin to describe the structured progression of a cyberattack. The room breaks down the attack lifecycle into seven distinct phases:
<li><b>Reconnaissance</b>– Gathering intelligence on targets through passive and active methods</li>
<li><b>Weaponization</b>– Crafting malicious payloads to exploit discovered vulnerabilities</li>
<li><b>Delivery</b> – Transmitting payloads via phishing, malicious links, or infected USBs</li>
<li><b>Exploitation</b> – Executing the malicious code on a victim's system</li>
<li><b>Installation</b> – Deploying malware or backdoors for persistent access</li>
<li><b>Command and Control (C2)</b> – Establishing remote control channels to the victim system</li>
<li><b>Actions on Objectives</b> – Performing the attacker’s end goals, such as exfiltration or destruction</li>

<h2>What I Learned:</h2>
<li>How each stage of the Cyber Kill Chain builds on the previous to form a complete attack path</li>
<li>How to recognize real-world attacker behaviors at each phase of an intrusion</li>
<li>The importance of disrupting attacks early in the chain to reduce damage</li>
<li>How SOC analysts map observed indicators of compromise (IOCs) to specific stages</li>
<li>The value of Kill Chain analysis in threat hunting, blue teaming, and incident response</li>
<li>Limitations of the Kill Chain and how newer frameworks (like MITRE ATT&CK) complement it</li>

<h2>Skills Gained:</h2>
<li>Adversary TTP (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) mapping</li>
<li>Threat modeling and attack lifecycle comprehension</li>
<li>Kill Chain-based incident detection and response</li>
<li>Application of defense-in-depth strategies</li>
<li>Cyber threat intelligence interpretation</li>
<li>SOC-aligned analysis and reporting</li>

Outcome:
This exercise strengthened my incident analysis and threat modeling skills. I gained a practical understanding of how advanced persistent threats (APTs) operate in real-world scenarios and how organizations can map such attacks using frameworks like the Cyber Kill Chain to improve their detection and response strategies.
