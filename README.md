# Cyber Kill Chain Lab
<b>Platform:</b> TryHackMe | <b>Type:</b> Hands-On Lab | <b>Focus:</b> Adversary Behavior Analysis, Attack Lifecycle, Threat Detection
<h2>Overview:</h2>
In this lab, I explored the Cyber Kill Chain, a model developed by Lockheed Martin to describe the structured progression of a cyberattack. The room breaks down the attack lifecycle into seven distinct phases:

Reconnaissance – Gathering intelligence on targets through passive and active methods

Weaponization – Crafting malicious payloads to exploit discovered vulnerabilities

Delivery – Transmitting payloads via phishing, malicious links, or infected USBs

Exploitation – Executing the malicious code on a victim's system

Installation – Deploying malware or backdoors for persistent access

Command and Control (C2) – Establishing remote control channels to the victim system

Actions on Objectives – Performing the attacker’s end goals, such as exfiltration or destruction

What I Learned:
How each stage of the Cyber Kill Chain builds on the previous to form a complete attack path

How to recognize real-world attacker behaviors at each phase of an intrusion

The importance of disrupting attacks early in the chain to reduce damage

How SOC analysts map observed indicators of compromise (IOCs) to specific stages

The value of Kill Chain analysis in threat hunting, blue teaming, and incident response

Limitations of the Kill Chain and how newer frameworks (like MITRE ATT&CK) complement it

Skills Gained:
Adversary TTP (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) mapping

Threat modeling and attack lifecycle comprehension

Kill Chain-based incident detection and response

Application of defense-in-depth strategies

Cyber threat intelligence interpretation

SOC-aligned analysis and reporting

Outcome:
This lab enhanced my ability to deconstruct and analyze cyberattacks through a structured, lifecycle-based framework. I can now leverage the Cyber Kill Chain to improve detection capabilities, inform defensive strategies, and communicate threats effectively within SOC and blue team environments.
